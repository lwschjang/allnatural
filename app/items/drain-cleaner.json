        "Drano Professional Strength Kitchen Crystals Clog Remover â€” The label says the product can cause blindness or death. The crystals left lodged in the plumbing can produce a caustic splashback or mix with other things you're washing down the drain to produce a dangerous chemical reaction."

        "For light drain cleaning, mix 1/2 cup salt in 4 liters water, heat (but not to a boil) and pour down the drain.",
        "For stronger cleaning, pour about 1/2 cup baking soda down the drain, then 1/2 cup vinegar. The resulting chemical reaction can break fatty acids down into soap and glycerine, allowing the clog to wash down the drain. After 15 minutes, pour in boiling water to clear residue. Caution: only use this method with metal plumbing. Plastic pipes can melt if excess boiling water is used. Also, do not use this method after trying a commercial drain opener--the vinegar can react with the drain opener to create dangerous fumes."
